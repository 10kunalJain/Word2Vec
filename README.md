# Word2Vec
Word2Vec is a groundbreaking project that uses deep learning to represent words as high-dimensional vectors, capturing semantic relationships. With Word2Vec, we can measure word similarity, find analogies, and perform algebraic operations on words. It enhances language modeling, information retrieval, sentiment analysis, and more.
